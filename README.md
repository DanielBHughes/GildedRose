Gilded Rose

Please run the tests using Nunit - they are in GuildedRoseTests.cs
The visual studio project will build and run from Visual studio as normal by pressing F5 and the output for 30 days is shown in the console.

Perhaps the code could be improved by refactoring - using a factory / strategy pattern but I have not had time to implementy this. I took the view that initially I wanted to write all the tests and get them passed and get the functionality working. I don't personally find the nested if statements intimidating - and I have seen some solutions to the kata online that look more complex than the original code!
